App for rent agreements management.

This program was created to replace MS Word table (wich contained few thousands of records), provide filtering capabilities and allow data access to multiple people at a time.
It was intended for LAN usage and deployed in a very unpleasant environment (ubuntu-server virtual machine with 256 MB ram running on Windows 7 host).
